		<h1>Hi</h1>
		<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.

What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?

Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.

Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
